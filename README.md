# Hello there ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¤“:
I am an enthusiastic coder who is just trying to improve his skills by doing all kinds of different stuff. I can work with SQL, PHP, and Python I would say on a comfortable level, where I understand what I am doing and how stuff works. Although I have also written websites with your basic stack consisting of CSS, HTML, and plain JavaScript. Before all that I have played around a lot with microcontrollers, (mostly Arduinos) but that is more on the electronics side of the spectrum than programming.

"***Competitive Programming***" is definitely not what I am doing, at most, I can call it solving programming problems. The platform I am mostly doing this on is called Leetcode. I started doing these problems in September 2022 and have more or less consistently solved at least the daily challenge, The exceptions are when I don't have any time or I just don't seem to understand the solution even with an explanation ðŸ˜ž, looking at you String Compression II. You can view my profile [here](https://leetcode.com/JOSCHLINER/), there you can see some more statistics, and also a heatmap of my activity.
